## Add your first set

In the beginning there was nothing. You arrive on an empty dashboard that asks you to add your first `purchases` or `sales`.

</Frame>

Let's learn how.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for the set">
    To add an item to your collection (in stock, for sale, sold, to be restored or wanted), start by displaying the set's file by entering its number in the search box.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a transaction">
    On the set sheet, click on the `+Add` button, then choose `Transaction`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter information">
    Fill in the fields.

<AddTransaction />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click `Save` to save your entry.
  </Step>
</Steps>
**Congratulations! You've just added your first set! The dashboard should now take your first transaction into account**.
