    </Frame>

You can import your collection by submitting a `.csv` file
<Note>Importing by csv file **only allows you to import sets or figs you own**. If you wish to import sets for sale or sold, you must first import them into the `owned` collection and then add the for sale or sold transactions from the Legaussitot interface.</Note>
<Warning>The number of lines in the CSV file must not exceed 100.</Warning>
### File format
The `.csv` file is a text file with the various fields separated by `;`.
It may or may not include a header line which, if present, must comply exactly with the following syntax:
```Rust
setid;itemid;date;purchase_price;status
```
For each set or fig you wish to import, you must add a line with the following information:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="input-text" title="setid (or figid)">
    <ResponseField name="setid" type="text" required>
      Setid or Figid of the set or fig you want to add.
    </ResponseField>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="input-numeric" title="itemid">
    <ResponseField name="itemid" type="integer" default="1">
      Item number (if you have several copies). If the field is empty, we take the value 1.
    </ResponseField>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="calendar-days" title="date">
    <ResponseField name="date" type="date" default="now()">
      Purchase date in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the field is empty, the current date is used.
    </ResponseField>
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion icon="input-numeric" title="purchase_price">
    <ResponseField name="purchase_price" type="decimal" default="0.00">
      Purchase price of the item. If the field is empty, 0.00 is used.
    </ResponseField>
  </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="list-dropdown" title="status">
      <ResponseField name="status" type="list" required>
        New or used?
        <Expandable title="properties">
          <ResponseField name="new" type="string">
            New item
          </ResponseField>
          <ResponseField name="used" type="string">
            Used item
          </ResponseField>
        </Expandable>
      </ResponseField>
    </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>

  Here is an example of a correct `.csv` file:
  ```Rust
setid;itemid;date;purchase_price;status
10220;2;2024-05-06;;used
910033;1;2024-05-06;210.25;new
40684;1;;;new
77050;;;;new
```
Then click on the `Import` button. The system will check the `.csv` file for any anomalies. 

If it contains errors, it will tell you where the errors are.
If this is correct it will import the file and create the records in the database.
<Note> No records will be created until the system detects errors. You can therefore submit your file several times without the risk of duplicates.</Note>
