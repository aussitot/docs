## Actions
### Update

If, in the [settings](/lg-english/settings) page, you have selected the `automatic update option`, you don't need to do anything. The page will be updated as soon as you view it.

When displaying the dashboard, the system performs numerous calculations and queries the APIs to retrieve the latest price and availability data. **When your collection becomes important, the loading time of the Dashboard page can become significant**. It is therefore advisable to deactivate the `automatic update option`. You will then need to click on the `Refresh button` at the top right of the dashboard to update it.

## Widgets

Widgets make up your dashboard. Made up of figures and graphs, they give you an overview of your collection. Below is a description of the main widgets that make up the dashboard.
