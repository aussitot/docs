    Yes and... no :)
    You won't find a Brickyfi application on the AppStore or Google play.

    **Brickyfi is a PWA (Progressive Web App)**. 
    A PWA, or Progressive Web App, is a web application that uses modern web technologies to provide a user experience similar to that of a native application, but which can be accessed via a web browser. PWAs combine the best features of websites and mobile apps, delivering a fast, reliable and engaging experience, while being easily installable and accessible from any device or platform.
    
    In short, PWAs offer a flexible and powerful alternative to traditional mobile apps, delivering an enhanced user experience while simplifying the development and distribution process for developers.
    ### Install the application on my home screen
    On an <Icon icon="apple" color="000000"/> Apple device, such as an iPhone or iPad, you can install a Progressive Web App (PWA) by following these steps:
    1. Open the Safari browser: Make sure you're using the Safari browser, as it's the only browser on iOS devices that supports PWA installation.
    2. Go to the website: https://app.brickyfi.com

    3. At the bottom of the Safari window, click on the share button <Icon icon="arrow-up-from-square" iconType="solid" color="000000"/>, then choose **Add to Home Screen** <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="regular" color="000000"/>

    Once added to the home screen, the application icon will appear just like any other application. You can now open it by tapping on its icon.
    The PWA will function as a native application, even if it's technically run from the Safari browser.
    <Info>For <Icon icon="android" color="000000"/> Android devices the procedure is pretty much identical. Most modern browsers on Android support PWAs, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.</Info>

    **Yes**.
    When no copies are for sale on BricklinkÂ®, Brickyfi uses ChatGPT to provide a price estimate.

    Prices that are calculated by ChatGPT are identified with the OpenAI logo in the set view or in the various listings.

    **Please note** prices estimated by the artificial intelligence system are generated from available data and sophisticated algorithms. However, please note the following:
1. **Data variability**: Price estimates may vary depending on the data used and changes in the market. Actual prices may differ from the estimates provided.
2. **Limited Accuracy**: While we strive to provide accurate estimates, artificial intelligence cannot always predict unforeseen market fluctuations, economic events or regulatory changes that may influence prices.
3. **Input Data Dependency**: The quality of estimates is highly dependent on input data. Incomplete or incorrect information can lead to erroneous estimates.
4. **Cautious use**: Estimates provided should be used as a guide only. We recommend consulting experts or carrying out additional research before making important financial or business decisions.
