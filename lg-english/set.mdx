## Presentation

The **Sets & Minifigs** page presents all useful information concerning a set or minifig. It can be accessed by entering a set or minifig reference (according to the Bricklink&reg; nomenclature) in the `search zone`. Depending on your [settings](/lg-english/settings), the information and widgets displayed may vary.

## Actions
### <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="regular" color="000000" size={24}/> Add a transaction

**Transactions represent all modifications to your item**. If you buy this item you must create a `owned` transaction, if you put it up for sale a `For sale` transaction. Once sold, you must create an `sold` transaction. Etc...

To do this, click on the `+Add` button in the top right-hand corner of the set file, then select `Transaction`.<br/>.
Then fill in the various fields and save.

<AddTransaction />

**A few examples:**
- You have a "new" item and decide it's time to build it.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a transaction">
    Click on the `+Add` button in the top right-hand corner, then choose `Transaction`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter information">
    Normally, a **owned** `transaction` already exists for this item (because you own it). Just change the `status` from **new** to **used** and save.
  </Step>
</Steps>

- You've bought (or been given) an item which, alas, is incomplete. You'll have to restore it.
<Steps>
  <Step title='Add an owned transaction'>
    Click on the `+Add` button at the top right, then choose `Transaction`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter information">
    Choose **owned** as the `transaction` for this item. Choose **used** as the `status` and finally enter the `purchase price` (which may be 0.00 in the case of a gift) and save.
  </Step>
     <Step title='Add a "to restore" transaction'>
    click on the top-right `+Add` button, then choose `Transaction`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter information">
    Choose **To restore** as the `transaction` for this item and save.
    <Tip>The **To restore** choice only appears if you have previously entered a **owned** `transaction`</Tip>.
  </Step>
</Steps>

- That's it, I've restored my item!

You can now either : 
- delete the `transaction` **To restore** by clicking on the red trash-can icon in the `Transactions history` widget at the very bottom of the page.
- add a new `transaction` **owned**.

### <Icon icon="trash-can" iconType="solid" color="000000" size={24}/> Delete a transaction

To delete a transaction, go to the `Transactions history` widget at the very bottom of the page.
Next to the transaction you wish to delete, click on the trash-can icon <Icon icon="trash-can" iconType="solid" color="D63939"/>.

### <Icon icon="puzzle-piece" iconType="regular" color="000000" size={24}/> Add a parts purchase

When an item is incomplete, you may need to purchase the missing parts on sites such as [Bricklink&reg;](https://www.bricklink.com).
You therefore need to update the `purchase price` of this item to take into account the purchase of these additional parts.

To do this, click on the `+Add` button in the top right-hand corner of the set file, then select `Parts purchased`.
Then fill in the various fields and save.

<AddParts />

Once saved, the `parts price` will be added to the `purchase price`.
