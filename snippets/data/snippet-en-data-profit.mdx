  <Accordion icon="input-numeric" title="Profit (PRF)">
    <ResponseField name="profit" type="decimal">
      The `profit` is the profit you will make by buying the item at the `purchase price` and selling it at the `selling price`.
      <p>$profit = selling\,price - purchase\,price$</p>
      The `margin` is then equal to that defined in [settings](/lg-english/settings).
      <p>$margin = \frac{profit}{purchase\,price}*100$</p>
